            What Is Spine Rehabilitation?
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Spine rehabilitation is a comprehensive treatment plan that involves
            exercises, education, and other therapies aimed at restoring the
            normal function of the spine. It’s tailored to the specific needs of
            the patient and is often used as part of the recovery process
            following spinal injuries or surgeries.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The program focuses on relieving pain, strengthening the muscles
            supporting the spine, and improving overall posture and flexibility.
            It also helps in enhancing the body's alignment and reducing strain
            on the back.
