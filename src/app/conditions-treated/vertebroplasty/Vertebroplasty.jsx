            Spinal fractures can significantly lower quality of life, cause excruciating pain, and impair mobility. Trauma, tumours that weaken the bone structure, and osteoporosis are some of the most frequent causes of these fractures. Traditional therapies like bracing, painkillers, or rest may not be sufficient for many patients. In these situations, <strong> Dr. Bhupendra Pratap Bharti </strong> often recommends vertebroplasty, a minimally invasive procedure that can significantly lessen pain and restore spinal stability.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            With its short recovery time, low surgical risk, and long-term advantages for patients with vertebral compression fractures, vertebroplasty has emerged as a key technique in contemporary spine care.

            Comprehending Vertebroplasty
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Medical-grade bone cement is injected into a fractured vertebra during a vertebroplasty, a percutaneous (through the skin) procedure. Within minutes, the cement solidifies, stabilizing the broken bone and halting further deterioration. The procedure restores spinal support and lessens pain by strengthening the vertebra.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            For many patients, vertebroplasty is a safer and less invasive option than traditional surgery because it only involves a tiny puncture as opposed to a large incision.

              The most common reason this procedure is advised is for osteoporotic compression fractures, which occur when weak bones give way under typical stress. <strong> Dr. Bhupendra Pratap Bharti </strong> highlights that timely intervention in such cases can prevent further complications and help patients regain mobility faster.

              Procedure and Recovery
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Although general anaesthesia may be used in certain situations, vertebroplasty is typically carried out as a day-care or short-stay procedure under local anaesthesia with sedation. The actions consist of:
            </p>

            <ol className="list-decimal list-outside px-4 space-y-2 mb-2 mt-2">
              <li>
                <strong> Preparation: </strong> Sterilize the skin and place the patient face down.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Needle Placement: </strong> A tiny needle is inserted into the fractured vertebra under the guidance of a fluoroscopic (X-ray) image.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Cement Injection: </strong> To fill in the gaps and fissures inside the vertebra, bone cement is carefully injected.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Stabilization: </strong> The bone is stabilized by the cement's rapid hardening.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Most patients are able to walk within a few hours of the procedure being finished, and it typically takes less than an hour in total.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Following a vertebroplasty, recovery is usually quick. Many patients report feeling less pain in as little as 24 to 48 hours. Resuming light activities in a day or two and gradually returning to normal mobility are important components of recovery. Also:
