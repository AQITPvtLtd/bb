          <p className="mb-2">
            Back and leg pain caused by a herniated or slipped disc can be debilitating, limiting mobility and interfering with daily activities. When conservative treatments such as medication, rest, and physiotherapy fail to provide relief, a surgical option known as discectomy may be recommended. <strong> Dr. Bhupendra Pratap Bharti </strong>, an expert in spine care, performs this procedure to remove the damaged portion of a spinal disc that is pressing on nearby nerves, thereby relieving pain and restoring function.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Discectomy has evolved significantly over the years, with modern techniques offering safer, <strong> minimally invasive </strong> options that reduce recovery times and improve outcomes.

            Understanding Discectomy
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            A <strong> discectomy </strong> is a surgical procedure designed to remove herniated disc material that compresses spinal nerves or the spinal cord. Herniated discs occur when the soft inner gel of a disc pushes through its tough outer layer, often causing nerve compression. This leads to symptoms such as radiating pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms or legs, depending on the location of the herniation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            By carefully removing the problematic portion of the disc while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible, discectomy aims to relieve nerve pressure and restore normal movement.

              The Procedure
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Modern discectomy procedures are often <strong> minimally invasive </strong>, using smaller incisions and specialized instruments. The steps typically include:
            </p>

            <ol className="list-decimal list-outside px-4 space-y-2 mb-2 mt-2">
              <li>
                <strong> Anaesthesia </strong> – general or spinal anaesthesia is administered for comfort.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Incision </strong> – a small incision is made over the affected area of the spine.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Access to the Disc </strong> – muscles are gently moved aside, and a small portion of bone or ligament may be removed for access.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Disc Removal </strong> – the surgeon removes the herniated portion of the disc that is compressing nerves.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Closure </strong> – the incision is closed, and the patient is moved to recovery.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Techniques such as <strong> microdiscectomy </strong> (using a microscope) or <strong>endoscopic discectomy</strong> (using a small camera) allow for even smaller incisions, faster recovery, and less tissue disruption.

              <li>
                Walking and light activities are encouraged within a few days.
              </li>
              <li>
                Strenuous activity, heavy lifting, and twisting should be avoided for several weeks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Physiotherapy is recommended to strengthen muscles, improve posture, and prevent recurrence.

            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Most patients notice a significant reduction in leg pain soon after surgery, while back stiffness may take longer to improve.
