            Selective Nerve Root Block (SNRB)
          </h1>

          <p className="mb-2">
            Patients most frequently seek spinal care for radiating leg pain and chronic back pain. These symptoms are frequently associated with irritation or compression of particular spinal nerves. It can be difficult to pinpoint the precise nerve causing pain, but doing so is necessary to develop a successful treatment strategy. Dr. Bhupendra Pratap Bharti explains that Selective Nerve Root Block (SNRB) is one of the most useful diagnostic and treatment techniques in these situations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            In addition to helping identify the cause of pain, SNRB offers short-term alleviation by delivering medication precisely where it is needed. This minimally invasive procedure can be an important step toward long-lasting recovery for patients who are experiencing chronic pain as a result of conditions like disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or degenerative changes.

            Comprehending Selective Nerve Root Block
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            A specialized injection technique called a selective nerve root block targets a single spinal nerve root that may be the source of pain. Medication is precisely administered to the affected area with the use of imaging guidance.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            SNRB acts locally, lowering inflammation and blocking pain signals at their source, in contrast to systemic drugs that act throughout the body. SNRB is regarded as a therapeutic intervention as well as a diagnostic tool due to its accuracy.

              Situations in Which SNRB Is Beneficial
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              When spinal nerve irritation or compression is suspected, SNRB is frequently used to treat the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside px-4 space-y-2 mb-2 mt-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Bulging or herniated discs: </strong> these occur when disc material presses against a nerve root.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Spinal Stenosis: </strong> compression of nerves due to spinal canal narrowing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Degenerative disc disease: </strong> age-related alterations that cause irritation of the nerves.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Post-Surgical Pain: </strong> symptoms that persist or recur following spine surgery.

              SNRB's Diagnostic Function
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              The ability of SNRB to identify the precise cause of pain is one of its main benefits. It can be challenging to determine which nerve is causing symptoms because several spinal levels can degenerate at the same time. <strong> Dr. Bhupendra Pratap Bharti </strong> explains that by blocking a particular nerve selectively at a time, doctors can identify whether it is the true source of pain.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              The targeted nerve is confirmed as the cause if the patient feels relief right away after the injection. This information is extremely helpful when choosing between various treatment options or organizing surgical procedures.

              <li>
                <strong>Pain Relief: </strong> Corticosteroids lessen inflammation in the vicinity of the nerve root.

              <li>
                <strong>Better Function: </strong> Patients are able to move and engage in rehabilitation more successfully when they are in less pain.

              <li>
                <strong>Preventing or Postponing Surgery: </strong> For certain patients, taking SNRBs repeatedly can be enough to control symptoms without the need for surgery right away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved Recovery: </strong> SNRB promotes a more seamless recuperation process by lowering acute pain.

            </h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Usually, selective nerve root block is done as an outpatient procedure. Among the steps are:

            <ol className="list-decimal list-outside px-4 space-y-2 mb-2 mt-2">
              <li>
                <strong> Preparation: </strong> the injection site is cleaned and the patient is positioned comfortably.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Imaging Guidance: </strong> A CT scan or fluoroscopy (X-ray) guarantees precise needle placement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Injection: </strong> an anti-inflammatory drug and local anaesthetic are administered around the nerve root.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Observation: </strong> The patient is observed for a short time before being released that same day.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Patients can quickly resume light activities after the procedure, which typically takes less than 30 minutes.

            <p className="mb-2">
              When carried out by qualified professionals, SNRB is regarded as a safe procedure. Although they are uncommon, potential risks include:

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside px-4 space-y-2 mb-2 mt-2">
              <li>
                Mild injection site soreness

              <li>
                Allergic reaction to medication
              </li>
              <li>
                Very uncommon complications like infection or bleeding
              </li>
              <li>
                Temporary numbness or weakness in the affected limb

            <p className="mb-4">
              Soon after the procedure, the majority of patients are able to resume their regular activities. Physiotherapy is frequently advised to strengthen supporting muscles and enhance spinal stability if pain is alleviated. Long-term results can be improved by combining SNRB with lifestyle changes like core strengthening and posture correction.
