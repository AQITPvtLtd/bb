            While they have never been highly common, spinal infections can have catastrophic consequences if they are not treated. Severe spinal deformities may arise from infections such pyogenic infections, fungal infections, or mycobacteria (Pott's disease), which can cause neurological impairments, persistent pain, and disability. Thankfully, post-infectious spine deficiencies can now be effectively rectified because to progress in health care technology and methods of surgery, and this greatly improves their quality of life for those who are impacted and restores mobility.

            Surgical Methods for Correcting Post-Infectious Spine Deformities
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Advances in spine surgery have made it possible to treat spinal abnormalities caused by infections using a variety of approaches. The kind, location, and degree of the malformation all influence the surgical method that is selected.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-outside px-4 space-y-4 mb-8">
            <li>
              <strong>Stabilization and Decompression of the Spine: </strong> In order to ease spinal cord or nerve compression, infected and injured bone tissue must be removed. After decompression, the spine is stabilized with transverse screws, rods, or plates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Surgery to correct kyphosis or scoliosis: </strong> Osteotomies, or bone-cutting operations, must be performed to restore spinal alignment in situations of severe abnormalities, particularly those brought on by tuberculosis. In severe cases, medications like spinal column resection (VCR) or spine subtraction osteotomy (PSO) are carried out.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Minimally Accessible Spine Surgery (MISS): </strong> Minimally invasive procedures can lessen surgical trauma for less severe abnormalities, resulting in a quicker recovery. Complications are reduced by methods like endoscopic procedures and through the skin instrumentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The anterior or the posterior Spinal Fusion: </strong>  While afterward spinal fusion is performed from the back, employing equipment to stabilize when fuse the vertebrae, anterior spinal fusion entails inserting a bone transplant between the vertebrae about the front side by side of the spine. Spinal fusion improves the affected segment and stops additional deformity progression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Utilization of Expandable Titanium Cages: </strong> Expanding titanium cages are employed to rebuild the spine and restore height and alignment in cases of significant vertebral destruction.
