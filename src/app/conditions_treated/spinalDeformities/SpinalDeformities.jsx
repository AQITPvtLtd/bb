              Spinal deformities refer to abnormal curvatures or misalignments of the spine that affect its shape and structure. These conditions can lead to pain, difficulty with movement, and potential complications if left untreated. Spinal deformities can occur due to congenital conditions, injuries, or degenerative diseases. The most common types of spinal deformities include scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis.

            <p>
              Spinal deformities, if left untreated, can lead to chronic pain, reduced mobility, and overall decreased quality of life. However, with timely intervention and appropriate treatment, many people can manage or correct these conditions. Whether through conservative measures like physical therapy or surgical interventions, seeking professional advice is key to addressing spinal deformities. If you suspect a spinal deformity, consult with a spine specialist to explore the best treatment options for your condition.
